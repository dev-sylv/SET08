Parsing and stringifying JSON data are two common operations when working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data in programming. Here's when to use each operation:

1. Parsing JSON:
   - Use parsing when you have JSON data in string format (e.g., received from an API or stored as a text file) and you want to convert it into a usable data structure in your programming language.
   - Parsing JSON is necessary when you want to access or manipulate the individual values or properties within the JSON data.

   In JavaScript, you can parse JSON using the `JSON.parse()` method:

   ```javascript
   const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
   const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
   ```

   This will convert the JSON string into a JavaScript object.

2. Stringifying JSON:
   - Use stringifying when you have a data structure (e.g., an object or an array) in your program, and you want to convert it into a JSON string. This is often done before sending data to a server, storing it in a file, or transmitting it over a network.

   In JavaScript, you can stringify an object into a JSON string using the `JSON.stringify()` method:

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   const jsonString = JSON.stringify(person);
   ```

   This will convert the `person` object into a JSON-formatted string:

   ```
   '{"name":"John","age":30}'
   ```

In summary, you parse JSON when you need to convert a JSON string into a usable data structure, and you stringify JSON when you need to convert a data structure into a JSON string for storage or transmission. These operations are fundamental when working with JSON data in programming.
